## Technical Details

### Database Queries

- Handles color variants and size variations
- Price range filtering with sale detection
- Real-time filtering with proper MongoDB query structure

### Performance
- Lazy loading of filter results
- Debounced filter requests

- Client-side caching of filter state

### Browser Compatibility

## Recent Fixes

### Category Filter Fix (Latest)
- **Issue**: Category filter was not working due to conflict between subcategory parameter and category filter
- **Solution**: Fixed category filter logic by prioritizing category filters over subcategory parameter
- **Result**: Category filtering now works correctly for both Dresses (16 products) and Tops (10 products)
- **Additional**: Updated categories to only include actual database categories (removed Bottoms, Rompers/Jumpsuits, Swim)

### Price Filter Fix
- **Issue**: Price filtering was not working due to incorrect `data-filter` attributes
- **Solution**: Changed price filter checkboxes from `data-filter="price"` to `data-filter="price_range"`
- **Result**: Price filtering now works correctly for all price ranges ($0-$25, $25-$50, $50-$75, $75-$100, $100+, On Sale)

## Future Enhancements
- Filter count badges showing number of products per filter
- URL state management for shareable filtered views
- Advanced filtering (brand, material, etc.)
- Filter presets and saved searches
- Analytics tracking for filter usage
